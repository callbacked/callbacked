# Hello!
I'm [@callbacked](https://github.com/callbacked) **ðŸ‘‹**

*  My interests lie in sysadmin, automation, DevOps, and SRE stuff
* Currently learning Ansible and other automation tools
* Currently run a Docker-based homelab running Fedora since 2019, it has been a great way to learn!
* Anticipated to graduate w/ a BS in Computer Science in 2024 @ UMass Lowell (may the hiring gods be in my favor by then)
