# Hello!
I'm @callbacked **ðŸ‘‹**

*  My interests lie in sysadmin, automation, DevOps, and SRE work
* Currently learning Ansible and other automation tools
* Currently run a Docker-based homelab running Fedora, it has been a great way to learn!
* Anticipated to graduate w/ a BS in Computer Science in 2024 @ UMass Lowell (may the hiring gods be in my favor then)
